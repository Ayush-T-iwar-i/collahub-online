## 🌟 Project Overview

**COLLAहUB** is a comprehensive college management system that digitizes the entire academic workflow of an institution. It supports three distinct user roles — Student, Teacher, and Admin — each with their own dedicated interface, navigation, and features.

The application is built with a **dark-themed glassmorphism UI**, role-specific color schemes, smooth animations, and a clean component architecture.

### What problem does it solve?
- Manual attendance registers → **Digital attendance marking**
- Paper result sheets → **Online result upload with auto-semester promotion**
- Notice boards → **Digital announcement system**
- Manual timetables → **Dynamic timetable management**
- Spreadsheet-based student data → **Searchable, filterable student management**

## 🔐 Authentication System

### Token Strategy
```
Login Response:
{
  accessToken:  JWT (expires in 15 minutes)
  refreshToken: JWT (expires in 7 days)
  user:         { id, name, email, role }
}

Storage: AsyncStorage
  - @access_token
  - @refresh_token
  - studentData / teacherData / adminData (user info)
```

### Auto Token Refresh
```
Request with expired accessToken
    ↓
API returns 401 Unauthorized
    ↓
Axios interceptor catches it
    ↓
POST /auth/refresh-token with refreshToken
    ↓
New accessToken received
    ↓
Original request retried automatically ✅
    ↓
If refreshToken also expired → Clear storage → Redirect to Login
```

### Registration Flow
```
Step 1  →  POST /auth/send-email-otp     (email entered)
Step 2  →  POST /auth/verify-email-otp   (OTP verified)
Step 3  →  POST /auth/register           (details submitted)
```

### Forgot Password Flow
```
Step 1  →  POST /auth/forgot-password    (send OTP to email)
Step 2  →  OTP verified (5-minute timer + resend option)
Step 3  →  POST /auth/reset-password     (new password set)
```

---

## 📊 Result & Semester System

### Type 1 — Assignment-Based Results (Automatic)
```
Teacher creates Assignment
    ↓
Student submits → Teacher grades it (Submission.marks)
    ↓
Student sees:
  - Subject-wise total marks and average
  - Exportable as PDF
```

### Type 2 — Semester Results (Admin uploaded)
```
Admin uploads result for a student's semester:
  Fields: semester, year, SGPA, CGPA, status, subjects[]

  If status = "pass"  →  student.semester += 1  (promoted)  ✅
  If status = "fail"  →  student.semester stays  (held back) ❌

Result is saved in student.results[] array (history maintained)
```

### Auto-Sync by Admission Year
For students who have no uploaded results yet, the system can calculate their current semester from their admission year:

```
Formula:
  yearsCompleted = currentYear - admissionYear
  if (currentMonth < July) yearsCompleted -= 1
  semester = (yearsCompleted × 2) + 1
  semester = clamp between 1 and 8

Example:
  Admission Year : 2023
  Current Date   : September 2025
  Years Completed: 2
  Semester       : (2 × 2) + 1 = 5
```

Trigger sync: `POST /results/sync-semesters` (Admin only)

## 🎨 UI Design System

### Color Palette by Role
| Role | Primary Color | Secondary | Background | Card |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|
| Student | `#00c6ff` Cyan | `#0072ff` Blue | `#080d17` | `#1a2535` |
| Teacher | `#f59e0b` Amber | `#d97706` Gold | `#080d17` | `#1a2535` |
| Admin | `#a78bfa` Purple | `#7c3aed` Violet | `#080d17` | `#1a2535` |

### Semantic Colors
```
Success   →  #34d399  (green)
Warning   →  #f59e0b  (amber)
Danger    →  #f87171  (red)
Info      →  #60a5fa  (blue)
Muted     →  #64748b  (slate)
Disabled  →  #374151  (dark gray)
```

### UI Patterns
- **Glassmorphism Cards** — semi-transparent with subtle borders
- **Linear Gradient** — backgrounds and CTA buttons
- **Bottom Sheet Modals** — forms, pickers, and confirmations
- **Progress Bars** — attendance percentage visualization
- **Step Bar** — multi-step registration flow indicator
- **Drill-Down Navigation** — College → Department → Students
- **Color-Coded Departments** — visual grouping for academic units
- **Breadcrumb Trail** — shows current location in drill-down

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Expo Go app on your phone
- Cloudinary account (free tier works)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COLLAहUB.git
cd COLLAहUB
```

### 2. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Create and fill .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Start the server
npm start
# or with auto-reload:
npx nodemon server.js
```

### 3. Setup Frontend
```bash
cd mobileApp
npm install
npx expo start
```

### 4. Connect Frontend to Your Backend
Open `services/api.js` and update the base URL:
```javascript
const API = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://192.168.x.x:5000",   // your local machine IP
  timeout: 10000,
});
```

> **Find your local IP:**
> - Windows: Run `ipconfig` → IPv4 Address
> - Mac/Linux: Run `ifconfig` → inet address

### 5. Run on Your Device
1. Install **Expo Go** from Play Store or App Store
2. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal
3. App will open on your device ✅

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Log

| # | Bug | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|---|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `semester` field not saving | Field missing in `User.js` schema | Added `semester: Number` to User model |
| 2 | `/students/all` returns empty array | Controller was querying wrong model | Fixed to query `User.find({ role: "student" })` |
| 3 | Teacher login shows white screen | Wrong component was saved in file | Rebuilt `teacher-login.js` from scratch |
| 4 | Admin route files not found | Filenames had trailing whitespace | Renamed via PowerShell `Rename-Item` |
| 5 | Import path `../../services/api` errors | Wrong relative path depth | Corrected all import paths in nested folders |
| 6 | Back button causes login loop | Using `router.push()` instead of `router.replace()` | Changed all auth redirects to `router.replace()` |
| 7 | `/admin/add-student` returns 404 | Route was not defined | Added `addStudent` and `addTeacher` to `adminController.js` |
| 8 | Student and User models conflict | Two separate schemas existed | Migrated everything to unified `User.js` model |
| 9 | `manage-subjects` warning in console | Filename had space: `manage-subjects .js` | Renamed the file to remove trailing space |
| 10 | Result system incomplete | Only assignment-based result existed | Added semester-based result upload with auto-promotion logic |
